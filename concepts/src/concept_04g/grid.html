    <h3>Open to the public, RISD's annual Graduate Thesis Exhibition features work in a wide range of media created by the 173 master's degree candidates graduating on May 31st in <span class="underline">Providence Convention Center</span>. Each student showcases a final body of work produced as the culmination of his or her experience in one of RISD's <span class="underline">15 graduate departments</span> exhibiting this year. With custom-constructed galleries within the large exhibition hall, students are given the opportunity to showcase multiple pieces or large installations from their thesis work—the manifestation of two or three years of research, experimentation, critical thinking and honing of their craftsmanship and expressive capabilities.

A selection of additional graduate student work is on view from May 30–June 1 at Sol Koffler Graduate Student Gallery, 169 Weybosset Street.</h3>
